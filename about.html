			<h3>&#63741;About&#63742;</h3>
			<p>Sheet music is participatory and collaborative by its very nature. When a composer or song writer publishes their sheet music, they're not just presenting a finished piece, but they're sharing their process. It invites us to play the music ourselves, and it give us insight into how the music works.</p>
			<p>Most sheet music marketplaces today are one of two things: either they are large publishing companies that only sell what is most popular, or they are for hobbyists only and offer no way to charge money or customize the look of the sheet music. Where do more serious, but still small scale creators go? Composers who make colorful scores with avant-garde techniques, or bands that want to share their creative process with their fans?</p>
			<p>There aren't a lot of great options, and people resort to very janky, homemade approaches, that are charming, but inconvenient for both the composer and their audience. I'm trying to build a better system: a marketplace for quality sheet music that is joyful for both the audiences and the creators. If you're looking to support small creators who put effort into their music, this is the platform for you. If you're a musician who wants to make their sheet music available to your audience, <a href="join.html">join ODE Music Publishing!</a></p>
