			<h3>&#63741;Join the Marketplace&#63742;</h3>
			<p>Artists on ODE Music Publishing make an unprecedented 90% of the profits generated through sales, artist's pages can be heavily customized in terms of look and feel, no music is too experimental or niche, and all the heavy lifting of making a digital market place will be taken care of for you. All you need to get started is a PayPal account to send the profits to, and a copy of your score!</p>
			<p>ODE Music Publishing is still a very small-scale operation. Right now it doesn't make sense to invest in the infrastructure required to make uploading sheet-music and creating an Artist's page automatic. For the time being, artists who wish to join the marketplace will have to reach out to me directly over email, and I will help get your music on the site.</p>
			<p>Send an email to RaelEwon@gmail.com with the following:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>The Artist/Band/Group name</li>
			<li>The email address associated with your PayPal account</li>
			<li>A PDF copy of the score you'd like to sell</li>
			<li>(optional) A brief description of the Artist/Band</li>
			<li>(optional) A description of the score</li>
			<li>(optional) A audio file of the score being performed</li>
			<li>(optional) Websites or social media accounts that you'd like to link to</li>
			<li>(optional) A picture of the Artist/Band</li>
			<li>(optional) Any additional files you'd like to include with the score download</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Of course, if you have any questions, feel free to email those as well. I look forward to hearing from you and I look forward to including your music in the marketplace!</p>
			<p id="fine">*90% profits is calculated by sending profits to the artist nine out of ten times and to ODE Music Publishing one out of ten times. This figure does not include the 3% PayPal charges per transaction.</p>
